# Overview

Basic Board Game. It is a simple board game with 10 squares. 
The goal of the play is to arrive at the final 
To be able to advance the player must flip a coin; if it's true, move forward two spaces; 
if it's false, choose whether to move forward one or backward one.
To be able to accomplish my application I have used: Variables (mutable and immutable), 
Expressions, Conditionals, Loops, Functions, Classes and Demonstrate data classes.

The purpose of creating this software was driven by my curiosity to explore a programming language widely 
used for general application development, including Android mobile app development.

# Development Environment

To develop the software, I used the Java Development Kit (JDK) and IntelliJ IDEA. 
The JDK was required to run and compile the Kotlin code, 
and IntelliJ IDEA was used as the integrated development environment to write,
build, and run the Kotlin project.

Kotlin and Android Studio
